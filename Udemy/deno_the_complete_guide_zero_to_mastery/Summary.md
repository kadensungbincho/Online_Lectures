# Why Deno?
- Rust, TypeScript, V8 Engine

# Deno Installation


# Deno Internal And Architecture
- Deno Process
    - v8 is a rusty_v8

# Exercise: Deno Architecture

# Deno Game Changers
- First class TypeScript
- ES Modules
- Security First
    - Allow permission to packages
- "Decentralized" modules
- Standard Library
- Built in Tooling
- Browser Compatible API
- Single Executable
- Async returns Promises
- Opinionated Modules

# Deno Security
- not trust anybody

# Deno Permissions
- Drake

# JavaScript
- JavaScript Engine
    - List of ECMAScript Engines

# Exercise: JS Engine
- Brendan Eich first created the JS engine

# Inside the Engine
- Parser -> AST -> Interpreter -> Bytecode
-                              -> Profiler -> compiler -> opimized code
    - astexplorer.net

# Inside the V8 engine
- JIT Compiler

# Comparing Other Language
- Is Javascript an interpreted language?
    - true, when it was developed
    - but it depends on how it's implemented

# Writing optimized code
- eval()
- arguments
- for in
- with
- delete

- hidden classes
- inline caching

# Web Assembly

# Call Stack & Memory Heap

# Stack Overflow

# Garbage Collection
- Mark And Sweep

# Memory Leaks
- Global variable
- Event Listeners
- setInterval

# Single Threaded
- one call stack
- javascript engine

# JS RunTime

# TypeScript
