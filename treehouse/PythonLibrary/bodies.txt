I am now taking deposits on the three remaining frenchie puppies that will be ready to go home on or after December 30. Each puppy will come with CKC registration, vaccinated, puppy pad trained, and with a one year health guarantee. I only feed them superior grain-free dog food and human-grade wet food, so each will also come with a small bag of dry food. They have been socialized and raised with a lot of love.

My available puppies are two white girls w/ black spots and a black male with a white belly. The hold deposit is $300 which is deducted from the $2000 rehoming fee. 

Please be familiar with this type of breed - they are wonderful companions but they do not come cheap. They must be kept inside - these dogs are sensitive to temperature. Serious inquiries only please! Happy to answer any questions you may have and send pictures via email.

My cat requires 5 mg of prednisolone daily, and I can't get it for her because the vet requires monthly blood work before they'll give me a refill. Does anyone know of a decent Canadian pharmacy that doesn't require a prescription? 
Please only ones that you've had personal experience with. I tried one last week that was recommended and they just stole my credit card number and tried to run up a bunch of crazy charges. 
Thank you from both of us, for any advice you can offer!!

How would you describe the perfect cat? She would have to be really sweet and have a great disposition.  She would have to be playful and loving and really affectionate.  She would have to sit on your lap and purr with joy at just being with you.  And maybe if your are lucky, she would also be beautiful.  Well, you have found her.  Would you really care if she has only one eye?  Please be the lucky person who gives this wonderful cat a furever home.  She is only 8 months old, FLV/FIV negative and has been spayed and vaccinated.  Please call  show contact info

Watching Posey play, we thought about how to advertise her.  Should we explain why she has only one eye? Should we tell people how joyous and happy she is? Should we try to explain what a wonderful disposition she has and how loving and affectionate she is?
We know we don't have to describe her beauty.  Maybe all we need to say is that this 8 month old white cat will win your heart.  We hope we have said enough to find this wonderful cat the perfect home. Call  show contact info

My dog Teddy went missing while on a walker with a dog walker on Thursday. Teddy has been seen in a number of neighborhoods, including Prospect Lefferts Gardens, Crown Heights, Prospect Heights, Clinton Hill, Windsor Terrace and in Prospect Park and the Brooklyn Botanic Gardens. She is a small/medium BLACK dog with a black collar and a GREEN BANDANA. If you see her, my number is  show contact info
. 

PLEASE if you are in Prospect Park, Brooklyn Botanic Gardens, or any grassy, tree-covered area, keep an eye out for her! She may be retreating to a quiet, secluded area if she is scared or hurt. Also, if you are visiting any local shelters, see if there are any small/medium, black female dogs - it's possible she has not been identified yet. If you see just a black dog wandering without a person, this may be her - her bandana may have come off by now. 

It is now her FOURTH night outside and she must be so scared, hungry, tired and cold. Any tips at all are appreciated! LARGE REWARD FOR HER SAFE RETURN!

Hello there!

I'm looking to adopt an adult cat!  I prefer an adult cat because you can easily get an idea of their personality, but let's be honest, if a kitten fell on my lap I wouldn't say no!

I would like a loving and affectionate companion to go home to everyday.  Sometimes my life gets stressful and one thing I noticed is that animals always ease my stress.  The cat will be mine but I have two roommates who are excited about the idea of having a cat in the apartment and who I know will give a cat a bunch of love as well.  I don't care about age.  I would adopt a senior cat as long as it's healthy and sweet tempered.  

I would like a cat who is also spayed/neutered and is up to date on vaccinations to make the transition to its new home less stressful for the cat and myself.  Also, I prefer a cat that's not too talkative. 

I'm 30 years old and I have had cats and dogs my entire life.  I have one tattoo and it's a tattoo (pictured) of a dog and a cat if that gives any indication for my love of animals.  

Any cat I adopt will stay with me for life!  Once it's mine, it will always be mine and well taken care of and loved.  

Feel free to text me:

Thank you!

Pomeranian+Puppy+AvailableThe Pomeranian is lively and eager to learn. They get along well with other household pets if given a slow and proper introduction. They make wonderful companions for families with older, well-behaved children and the elderly.
Character
The Pomeranian is a compact, active toy breed. They are intelligent, extremely loyal to their family, and loving. They are eager to please, gentle, and affectionate. They also exhibit an inquisitive expression and curiosity.
Temperament
The Pomeranian is confident, commanding, and outgoing. Due to the Pomeranians small stature they are not recommended for homes with small children as they may become temperamental. They make excellent guard dogs and will sound a bark when they sense danger.
Care
In addition to grooming it is important for Pomeranians to receive excellent dental care. They are prone to tooth loss; so regular cleaning is a must. Dry food is recommended to aid in keeping teeth and gums healthy.
Coat
The Pomeranians long double coat requires brushing at least once weekly. It is important to lift and part the top coat and brush the cottony undercoat as well. This will reduce shedding. Frequent brushing can damage the coat.
Training
Pomeranians respond best to firm commands and are quick to learn. They are easily trained in obedience. Their barking must be controlled or they will do so incessantly. They may be difficult in housebreaking, but with consistency and praise do very well either going outside or in a litter box.
Activity
The Pomeranian requires short walks and play time with other pets and family. They have the capability to learn tricks if done with patience and time. They may become bored if they are not given enough to do. They are excellent for apartment living and homes with small yards.
Weight
3-7 lbs
Height
8-11 inches
Color(s)

Meet Delphine, a charming beauty who is more than happy to grace you with her presence. Approximately 9-years-old, she has kitten-like curiosity and readily investigates the world around her. She likes her toys and plays with them gently like the lady she is. Delphine is also quite mellow, and enjoys sitting next to you or better yet, curling up in your lap as you read or watch TV. Her slow blinks show just how content she is to chill out. Delphine's soothing purrs will make a stress-filled day disappear in an instant or make a quiet moment all the more relaxing.

While we like to think of Delphine as a princess, she is a very low-key, low maintenance kitty which makes her the perfect fit for almost any family. Finding a loving forever home is all that is needed to complete her happiness. Could it be yours? Contact us to meet Delphine today!

Hi!
I have 1 beautiful female Lionhead Bunny, Lilly. She is about 1 and a 1/2 years old. She has been a great, friendly, and loving companion, but you know what they say, they breed like rabbits, and at one point had 17 bunnies! Now I have 4. I would not like to release them into the woods, because they wouldn't survive. I know I said free, but the rehoming fee is 100, and is negotiable.
If you are interested, please text me at¬†

Double and Darling are littermates. 
They have been here a very short time and are still very shy, 
so they require adoptive 
homes where people will be patient and willing to work with them.
All their veterinary work has been done.

Check out Barbara's website at barbarathecatlady.org
A completed application form must be filled out, plus an adoption fee and a hard cat carrier are required to adopt these kitties.

Happily, our rescue group has some lovely kittens to adopt into responsible safe forever homes.
We are trying to adopt out the young kittens in pairs, unless you have another cat to keep the kitty company.
The kittens are old enough to eat on their own and will be ready for adoption some in December.
The kittens range in age from 6 weeks to 14 weeks.
The kittens are adorable and playful, plus seek attention, and are being vetted.

We are carefully screening all potential adopters -- (intense interview process)
There is an adoption fee, and a complete adoption application must be filled out -- the group will check references, plus a home visit.

Check out Rusty, the sweet 4 year old Orange Tabby. He's an adorable snuggle bun who gives major head butts when you pet him. Within minutes of arriving in his new foster home, he was up on the couch napping with the resident kitty.

He's a curious cat who likes to explore and situate himself in little cubbies like boxes. But most of all, he just wants plenty of love.

Rusty was rescued from the NYC kill shelter where he was a staff favorite because of his winning personality, Inquire about Rusty today!

Hey guys I have a BEAUTIFUL 7 month old kitten named Bonnie born on Easter. She's extremely playful, great with kids, litter trained, eats dry food (at times wet mixed with dry). She is also up to date with her shots and vaccinations. Only thing is that she is not spayed/neutered. Unfortunately I didn't know until recently but I have really bad allergies :( I want to find her an owner that will take good care of her, be loving and attentive (I can weed out the liars & psychos very easily btw). I have her litter box (expensive walk in with door), scratching post, toys, food and water bowls, travel bag (very nice) and a case of some wet food. Also have a pooper scooper and other miscellaneous items. 200 to the right owner  Call or text  show contact info

We are a small family in Queens that recently had a litter of gorgeous F1B standard goldendoodles. All but one have been placed in their now forever homes. 

Pringle is 4 month old male apricot F1B goldendoodle born July 14th, has received all his vaccines including rabies, on a top of the line flea preventative and incredibly friendly (and handsome!). He is already well over 30lb and we estimate he will be around 70-80lb fully grown. So he will be a very very big boy. 

To learn more about the litter, birthing and Pringle's parents, check out our temporary website chock full of photos and info:

www.CLgoldendoodles.wixsite.com/adopt

It says all pups are unavailable but we had some unfortunate personal issues with Pringle's original buyer, making him once again available. 

Reply to this post via email or text or call me at  show contact info
 and I will give you further information on the adoption process, or more recent pictures and videos. The rehome fee is only $650.

I am trying to spend no more than $900. I can pay immediately and can give references if requested.

Most of these posts are from backyard breeders and puppy mills. They post from several different locations to throw people off their trail.  They even pretend to be people looking for a specific breed when actually they are selling them. Rather than buying a pet for >$500 from someone sketchy on Craigslist, walk into any animal rescue organization and save an animal in need, who will love you to death and will likely be under $100. Don't support these idiots, they do not treat the animals well and they are selling, not rescuing them. It is against Craigslist's terms to sell animals on here, so please report those posts. Also, do not send money for an animal sight unseen, and if you meet someone, do it in public, for your safety.    


QR Code Link to This Post


... This is a scam. There are some legit ads for animals that need rescuing on here, but there are also a TON of scams. If the animal is a purebred, it is most likely to be a scam. If the fee is over ~$150, it is probably a scam. If the location the ad is posted in is different from the location the person says the animal is in when you talk to them, it is probably a scam. If there is a phone number and it rings into a generic voicemail, it is most likely a scam. If the writing is barely literate, it's most likely a scam. If the image of the animal looks like a stock photo, it's probably a scam. Do yourself a favor and don't even answer these ads. Better yet, flag them. They are mostly backyard breeders and "puppy mills" trying to make money off of mistreated and sick animals. The ads for Westies, Huskies, Maltese, Yorkies, French/English Bulldogs, Persians, Bengals etc. are almost all scams. I am posting an example of an email that is typical of what you get in response to your inquiry. Do not send any money for a pet sight unseen. Do not have animals shipped to you. Do not meet people at their home- meet them in a public place like a Target parking lot with the animal. Be careful!
