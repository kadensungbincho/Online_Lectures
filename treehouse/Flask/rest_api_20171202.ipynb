    "- REST is really just another layer of meaning on top of HTTP.\n",
    "- `When you build a website or app, you're building a UI for your app's logic and data model. The point of an API though, is not to create a traditional UI, but to provide a programmatic inerface, a code UI if you will, to that same logic and data model. The major difference is that all communication is done through HTTP, and the burden of creating the interface is on the users of the API, not the creator.`\n",

    "- code that makes it easier for things outside of our application to interact with our application. Why need this kinds of gateways?\n",

    "- our code usually is running on one server, we need to talk to from somewhere outside. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Maybe we have a server running for hadling the scores of our game from all caross the globe and want to be able to update scores from PC, mobile phone, or tablets. We could write some sort of bridge or connection later, but we might have do that for every new device. \n",
    "\n",
    "- ** Building a REST API that works with any external client anywhere on the Internet saves us a lot of headaches.** \n",
    "- REST : Representational State Transfer.\n",
    "- The web, is by design, stateless.\n",
    "- This means that every request you make to a website is like meeting that site for the very first time. \n",
    "- REST doesn't break this, and puts all of the work of remembering state on the client, which is your computer, or program. After each request the server forgets your client entirely. \n",
    "- Your client though can and will hold on to whatever state info it needs like key."
